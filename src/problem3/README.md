### Category A: Logic & Type Safety Flaws

These are the most critical issues as they directly cause bugs or unexpected behavior.

1.  **Type Error: The `blockchain` Property Does Not Exist on the `WalletBalance` Interface**

    - **The Issue:** The code accesses `balance.blockchain`, but the `WalletBalance` interface does not define this property.
    - **Why:** This is a fundamental TypeScript error. It defeats the purpose of type safety, preventing the compiler from catching the error and potentially leading to `undefined` at runtime.
    - **The Solution:** Extend the `WalletBalance` interface to include `blockchain: string`.

2.  **Reference Error: The `lhsPriority` Variable is Undefined**

    - **The Issue:** The `filter` logic uses the `lhsPriority` variable without declaring it.
    - **Why:** This causes an immediate `ReferenceError` when the component renders, crashing the application.
    - **The Solution:** Replace it with the correct variable in scope, which is likely `balancePriority`.

3.  **Inverted & Confusing Filter Logic**

    - **The Issue:** The condition `if (balance.amount <= 0) { return true; }` keeps wallets with zero or negative balances, while discarding those with positive balances.
    - **Why:** This contradicts common user expectations (which is to display valuable assets). It creates a poor user experience and is likely a logical bug.
    - **The Solution:** Invert the logic to `balance.amount > 0` to display only wallets with assets.

4.  **Potential for `NaN` (Not-a-Number) Calculation**

    - **The Issue:** The line `const usdValue = prices[balance.currency] * balance.amount;` does not handle the case where `prices[balance.currency]` is `undefined`.
    - **Why:** `undefined * number` results in `NaN`, which leads to display errors on the UI. This is a common pitfall when working with dynamic API data.
    - **The Solution:** Apply defensive coding by providing a default value: `(prices[balance.currency] || 0) * balance.amount`.

5.  **Use of `any` in a Function Parameter**

    - **The Issue:** The `getPriority` function accepts `blockchain: any`.
    - **Why:** `any` is an escape hatch from TypeScript's type system, disabling type safety and autocomplete capabilities. It hides potential bugs.
    - **The Solution:** Use a specific type: `blockchain: string`.

### Category B: Performance & Structural Anti-Patterns

These issues affect the application's scalability, maintainability, and speed.

6.  **Misuse and Incorrect Usage of `useMemo` (Inefficient Memoization)**

    - **The Issue:** The dependency array for `useMemo` is `[balances, prices]`, while the calculation logic only depends on `balances`.
    - **Why:** This causes the entire expensive `filter` and `sort` process to re-run unnecessarily every time `prices` changes, even if `balances` remains the same. This is a critical waste of resources.
    - **The Solution:** Adjust the dependency array to only include variables that the hook actually depends on.

7.  **Redundant and Unnecessary Computations Outside of `useMemo`**

    - **The Issue:** After calculating `sortedBalances`, the code proceeds to perform two separate `.map()` loops on every render.
    - **Why:** This nullifies the benefits of `useMemo`. The component still performs heavy work on every render.
    - **The Solution:** Consolidate the entire data processing chain (`filter`, `sort`, and `map` to JSX) inside a single `useMemo` hook.

8.  **Function Re-creation on Every Render**

    - **The Issue:** The `getPriority` function is defined inside the component.
    - **Why:** A new version of the function is created in memory every time the component renders. Since this function is "pure," this is completely unnecessary, wastes resources, and can break the memoization of child components.
    - **The Solution:** Move the `getPriority` function outside the component's scope.

9.  **Anti-pattern: Using Index as a `key` in a List**

    - **The Issue:** `key={index}` is used in the `map` loop.
    - **Why:** React uses `key` to uniquely identify elements. An `index` is not a stable identifier. If the list is re-sorted, React can get confused, leading to display bugs and poor rendering performance.
    - **The Solution:** Use a unique and stable value from the data itself, such as `balance.currency`.

### Category C: Design & Code Quality Issues

These points indicate a lack of experience and can make the code hard to maintain.

10. **Violation of the Open-Closed Principle (OCP)**

    - **The Issue:** The `getPriority` logic uses a `switch-case`, which is a "closed" structure.
    - **Why:** Every time a new blockchain needs to be supported, a developer must modify the source code of the function. This violates the OCP ("open for extension, but closed for modification").
    - **The Solution:** Use a more extensible data structure like a mapping object (e.g., `Record<string, number>`).

11. **Verbose Sorting Logic**

    - **The Issue:** The `sort` function uses a verbose `if/else if` structure to return `-1` or `1`.
    - **Why:** It's hard to read and unnecessary for numeric comparison.
    - **The Solution:** Leverage arithmetic comparison. `rightPriority - leftPriority` will automatically return a negative, positive, or zero value, making the code more concise.

12. **Incorrect Currency Formatting**

    - **The Issue:** `balance.amount.toFixed()` is used without an argument.
    - **Why:** It defaults to rounding to zero decimal places (e.g., `123.45` becomes `"123"`). This is inappropriate for displaying financial values.
    - **The Solution:** Explicitly specify the number of decimal places: `toFixed(2)`.

13. **Unused `children` Prop**

    - **The Issue:** The `children` prop is destructured but never used in the JSX.
    - **Why:** This is redundant code that introduces noise and can confuse other developers about the component's purpose.
    - **The Solution:** Remove `children` from the props if it is not needed.
